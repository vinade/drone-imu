* The BMP180 must be in contact with the ambient air to carry out the measurements. If you need to integrate the sensor into a housing, do not forget to provide holes for air circulation.
* Do not expose the BMP180 excessively to the airflow of a fan, as this may result in erroneous or very fluctuating measurements.
* The measurement of the atmospheric pressure depends on the temperature. Avoid placing the BMP180 in front of a source of heat, still less in front of a source producing rapid changes (heating, window in full sun â€¦).
* The BMP180 is sensitive to moisture and is not intended for direct contact with water.
* It is also sensitive to light. It should be protected as much as possible from ambient light. Do not place the sensor in front of the ventilation hole of your case, for example.
* The BMP180 accepts a supply voltage between 1.8 and 3.6 Volts. The best way is to use the 3.3V output of your Arduino without ever exceeding 3.6V (according to Sparkfun).
